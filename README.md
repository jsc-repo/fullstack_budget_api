Users can sign up with a social account (google/github) and are authenticated with a simple token. Users can create/edit/delete expenses and check basic statistics with a graph to show how much they are spending per category. 

The tech stack used are the following: 
- React
- Django Rest Framework
- TanStack Query for data fetching/mutating
- Zustand for state management
- Sqlite
